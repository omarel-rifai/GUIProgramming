        <h2>About the Fitness Industry & My Journey</h2>
        <p>
            Over the years, the fitness industry has been growing rapidly. Rising fitness creators, more gym memberships being signed up every day, more products and businesses in the industry thriving. 
            I am no different. After achieving my ISSA certificate in physical training and reaching my dream body, I've inspired many people to do the same. 
            Fitness is not just a hobby, it's a lifestyle. This website is dedicated to showing what fitness is really about: being healthy, happy, and constantly improving.
